## Intro

The is is an example of a Play project that uses functional domain modeling approach in it's design.
This is a, very simplified, REST API for a fictional DVD rental application.

## Goals

1. When you start a new project, it often takes months to gain enough domain knowledge to properly implement it.
Often it's too late at that point and you are stuck with design decisions you made early in the project.
As a developer, you want to *delay* making decisions on concrete implementation until you gain enough
domain knowledge.
1. You want to separate domain complexity from [accidental complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) that comes from using a particular framework
 or a library.

## Evolution of The Functional Domain Model

### 1. Parametrize Types In The Service Trait

```scala
trait RentalService[Movie, Customer, DVD, Timestamp] {

  def addMovie(movie: Movie, qty: Int): Set[DVD]
  def findDVD(movie: Movie): Option[DVD]
  def rentDVD(customer: Customer, dvd: DVD, timestamp: Timestamp): Unit
  def returnDVD(customer: Customer, dvd: DVD, timestamp: Timestamp): Unit

}
```

### 2. Add Higher-kind Wrapper `M[_]` Around Results

```scala
trait RentalService[M[_], Movie, Customer, DVD, Timestamp] {

  def addMovie(movie: Movie, qty: Int): M[Set[DVD]]
  def findDVD(movie: Movie): M[Option[DVD]]
  def rentDVD(customer: Customer, dvd: DVD, timestamp: Timestamp): M[Unit]
  def returnDVD(customer: Customer, dvd: DVD, timestamp: Timestamp): M[Unit]

}
```

#### What are all the choices for `M[_]` ?

`M[_]`                  | Description
----------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------
`Id`                    | A do-nothing monad: `type Id[A] = A`. Same as not having `M`
`Error \/ A`            | Adds error handling: `type Valid[A] = Error \/ A`
`Future`                | Async service
`Future[Error \/ A]`    | Best of the above two. Can be turned into a Monad using `EitherT[Future, Error, A]`

### 4. Start Defining Business Domain Rules
```scala
  "After adding DVDs, you should be able to rent at least one" in forAll(movies -> "movie", qtys -> "qty", customers -> "customer", timestamps -> "timestamp") {
    (movie, qty, customer, timestamp) =>

      withService { service =>

        whenever(qty > 0) {

          val respones = for {
            dvds  <- service.addMovie(movie, qty)
            aDvd  = Random.shuffle(dvds.toList).head
            r     <- service.rentDVD(customer, aDvd, timestamp)
          } yield r

          whenReady(respones.run) { result =>
            result shouldBe right
          }
        }
      }
  }
```

Notice that, at this point, we still don't have any concrete implementation of what "Movie", "DVD", etc are.
We can't introduce any accidental complexity from the implementation because there, simply, isn't any
implementation yet.

This is what Test Driven Development (TDD) should really be like.


### 5. Define Repository Trait

Make dependency on repository explicit. In the context.

Our `M[_]` becomes a function: `Repository => Future[Error \/ A]`

```scala
type ServiceResult[A, Repo <: Repository] = Kleisli[AsyncResult, Repo, A]
```

### 3. Implement Controllers

### 6. Naive Implementation of The Domain

### 7. Implement Domain Using Repository Backed by Relational Database

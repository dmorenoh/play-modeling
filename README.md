# Functional Domain Modeling in Play

## Intro

The is is an example of a Play project that uses functional domain modeling approach to it's desig.
This is a, very simplified, REST API for a fictional DVD rental application.

## Goals

1. When you start a new project, it often takes months to gain enough domain knowledge to properly implement it.
Often it's too late at that point and you are stuck with design decisions you made early in the project.
As a developer, you want to *delay* making decisions on concrete implementation until you gain enough
domain knowledge.
1. You want to separate domain complexity from accidental complexity that comes from using a particular framework
 or a library.

## Evolution Of The Functional Domain Model

### 1. Parametrize Types In The Service Trait

### 2. Add Higher-kind Wrapper Around Results

### 4. Start Defining Business Domain Rules

### 5. Define Repository Trait

### 3. Implement Controllers

### 6. Naive Implementation Of The Domain

### 7. Implement Domain Using Repository Backed By Relational Database
